<p>
A mountain goat was chumping grass . Its long tounge scuttled out for
more in the cervices of rocks .  Its brown fur ruffled by the wind hid
it in the sorroundings. It froze every now and then on hearing a stone
falling or hearing an eagle cry, then started chewing again.  Layers
of fine crystal sparkled on the grey and brown boulders in the pale
sunlight.
</p>

<p>
A shape stuck out of the mountain wall and fell on the goat.  There
was sound of bone cracking and tendons being torn. Fresh blood flecked
the rocks and grass red.The black spots on leopardess' fur rose and
fell with her fast breaths. A triumphant roar tore through the sky.
The dead goat shook by the eager bites and tugging of the leopard
cubs. They had come a few months before and their hunger increased
with each day. Whatever the leopardess hunted down was not enough to
fill their bellies. She took out the bigger organs and chewed them
into smaller pieces which the cubs could swallow.  Two of the cubs
started fighting over a big chunk of meat, pulling it away from each
other. She carried them one by one in her jaws and dropped them with
the others.  Then she also dug her mouth into the caracass. Afterwards
the whole lot fell asleep, the hair on their muzzles dyed red .
</p>


<p>
“ This one for fifteen rupees madam.” Bhola said.  “ Too costly&#x2026;
But I can take two for twenty.” said the woman.  Bhola considered the
offer for a while and agreed.  His bag was filled with many crafts of
wood &#x2014; wooden pen fitted with cheap pearls, combs, cross- stands,
little idols of gods and goddesses, key rings,little men carrying a
tiny axe,women with bangles on their wrist,cars,houses&#x2013; almost
anything that caught his fancy he made and sold it for a living.  It
was beyond evening and he started for home.  “ ey Bhola.” shouted a
short man. He hopped to Bhola with his firm potbelly swinging from
side to side.  “So ..huff&#x2026;  made any ..huff&#x2026;sold anything today?”
asked the man .  “ Just a little.” said Bhola in a low voice.  His
head was down and gaze away from the man.  “When will I get my money
then?May be next week or next month or may be next year.”  The man was
shouting.  “I am trying.I am not able to sell much.” said Bhola “I
have waited enough. Do what you may but I want my money before this
month ends.”
</p>

<p>
Bhola knocked at the door of a shanty house. A thin woman in a yellow
dress opened the door. She took the jhola from his shoulder and kept
in one corner.  “ Baba for you.” immediately a glass of water was
thrust at his face by little hands. He drank the water slowly taking
few sips at a time. Then he put down the glass and gave out a
deliberate sigh.“ Now I feel refreshed.” said Bhola. The girl was
fidgeting on the spot smiling with anticipation. The bangles on her
hands jingled against each other. “ So, what is there for my girl
today?” he said . His right hand searched inside the pockets of his
kurta.” Ah! I found something.”  He took out a pack of colourful
sketches. The girl delightedly took hold of them admiring the bright
attrative packet. “Baba I will draw and show you somthing.” she said
happily and ran to fetch her drawing book.
</p>

<p>
“ How was today?”  asked his wife.  “Fine” said Bhola.  She went to
the corner and picked up the jhola. “ It's been just as heavy for many
days.” she said wieghng it in her arms. Bhola knew he had to put up
some fight. “ Okay. The sales have not been that good for some
time. But from now on things will only improve. Who does not have a
bad day or two?” said Bhola. His wife knew he was lying. It had not
been just two bad days.  She sat besides him . The furrows in her
forehead dissappeared and her expression became soft.Bhola was looking
outside through the plastic door by which ran a small stream of sewage
and waste. ”For how long we will go on like this ?” she said.
</p>

<p>
Bhola was unable to sleep even though he was tired.  He was sitting
on the stool watching the sleeping figures of his wife and daughter.
His wife looked much younger without the lines of worry which she
bore during the day. His daughter was curled against her mother. Neon
light fell from the gaps in the plastic wall painting the room black
and orange. On the roof the mice squeaked and scuttled. In one corner
lay a water can almost empty. His wife would have to line up in the
morning before the tap. His daughter would have to help in chores
too. A stink of sewage came wafting over the hot night air . A pipe
must have burst somewhere. Bhola thought how could he make their
lives better. He would put in more hours in selling and roaming the
streets. He would make new things something that would catch the eye
of people with money. May be he should make a big statue. That would
be difficult and expensive. And if no one bought it then..  Slowly
the thoughts ebbed from his mind and he fell asleep.
</p>

<p>
Coal black rocks sprawled over the wall of the cave . The lepardess
had not hunted for a week now.  The prey was becoming harder to
find. The one she had spotted and chased springing from rock to rock,
and finally caught hold of , slipped from her jaws and jumped into the
cold blue stream . Since the past two days snow rained continuously
from the dense white sky. A row of small sleeping heads with their
bodies mushed together lay huddled in a corner.  The howling of the
wind reverberated inside the cave. The leopardess sat on all fours
with her long furry tail curved agianst her body. Her grey eyes shone
from the light coming out of the mouth of the cave which looked like a
white window inside the dark cave.  Sometimes her neck fell to one
side and she fell asleep.  But the howling wind kept her awake.
Earlier the biggest of the cubs held the neck of the other one in its
jaws while third was pulling at his tail by its canines.  The big cub
squeaked and meowed and let go of its hold . Then it turned towards
the other and growled at him. Both of them then stood on their hind
legs and lapped their paws against each other.  Meanwhile the third
one got on top of a big rock and jumped in between them. The bigger
one saw its chance in the confusion and kicked one of them and bit the
other at the back. Then it growled and meowed in victory.  The big cub
felt emboldened. It sat carefully on all its fours. Its lower body
just inches above the ground and its thick tail stretched out and
started taking small tapping steps towards the mouth of the cave. When
it reached near enough, the leopardess gave out a low runting
snarl. It quickly shot as a bolt from there and cuddled in between the
other cubs.
</p>

<p>
On the table lay various chisels, gouges, knives and a pair of
mallets. Coils of shaven wood lay everywhere on the floor. Here and
there lay unfinished pieces of men, women, horse ,cattle, boat and
others which could not be yet made out. Paint brushes of many lengths
were dipped inside small tin cans filled with varnish or polish.  The
smell of turpentine and paint floated in air. Regular knocking of wood
against wood rattled across the room.Bhola was chipping at a new piece
and chiseled till a face, eyes , nose and limbs appeared on the
figuriene . Then he rubbed the surface with sand paper and applied
paint and varnish.  His daughter was standing nearby holding a drawing
chart. She had drawn a mountain with river flowing straight from it.
The half sun shone with straight rays and rested in between the slopes
of mountains. Clouds and leaves of trees had the same shape and
differed only in color.  By the river stood a hut drawn with a skewed
slanting roof.  It was not wise to disturb Bhola when he was deep in
woodcraft.  'Ba&#x2026;Ba..' she began in her thin voice.  Bhola had seen
her coming from the side. He turned towards her, his face still locked
in concentration broke into a smile.  “ Show me.” he said taking the
paper into his rough hands. “ Its good. Hmm.. the mountains are
perfect , the sun is also drawn well. The trees are ok. But the roof
could have been drawn better. Overall it's a good drawing in the first
attempt.” came Bhola's verdict.  The girl was not too happy with such
comments.  “ Even I could not make good pieces when I began. I used to
get badly thrashed by my baba. I was slow and only learned after a lot
of practice.”  The girl was smug over the thought of her father being
lousy and getting beaten for it.
</p>

<p>
Just then his wife came over breathing heavily carrying a big can of
water. Drops of sweat broke on her face and ran down till her
chin. Her wet hair was plastered on her skull.  She sat on the stool
and her look lingered on the wooden pieces.  She shook her head
hopelessely. This was not lost on Bhola.  “ Where are you going now?”
she asked. “ I have to meet someone.” Bhola said as he started to go.
The girl hurriedly folded her drawing and hid it under the mat. “ Baba
I want to come too.”  Both of them went outside.  She saw the wood
litter spread across the room. “ Now I have to clean up this mess
too.” she thought.  A spasm of anger ran through her . She got up and
with a fling of her arm knocked down the tools and wooden pieces . She
was on the verge of upturning the table when one of the pieces caught
her eye.  Curious she picked it up from the floor. It was not one of
those pieces which looked all the same to each other. There was a
small mole on its cheek, one of its big toe was missing and its thin
body was painted over as a yellow sari. It was her figuriene.
</p>

<p>
Clouds had broken against the blue sky. The leopardess was waiting
patiently above the grey rocks, her eyes set on a patch of vegetation
growing on flat rock jutting out of the mountain.  The rossetted
patterns on her coat blended in with the rocks rendering her
invisible. At one time she was tempted to pounce on the eagle which
flew right in front of her. But that would have been hardly sufficient
for a family for four and she could have fallen into the cold river
below.
</p>

<p>
The smallest of pebbles fell making ticking sounds against the slaty
rocks.  From above a big mountain goat was trudging down breaking its
fall at the edges and gaps in the mountain . The moment its hoofs
touched the grass patch the leopardess moved.The blades of her
shoulder slid smoothly under her furry skin,with her tail floating
behind.  Her jaw was opened in mid air as she pounced on the goat.
She missed its neck and instead her jaw cut into the goat's
flank. The powerful goat kicked its hindlegs everywhere in the
air. The long tail of the leopardess danced as she struggled to keep
her hold. She had to swerve continuously to avoid getting a kick in
her guts or a blow of the strong horns aimed at her chest .
</p>

<p>
The cubs meowed and jumped up and down all about her, sniffing and
scratching at her dusty and ruffled coat with their small paws . She
growled with all her canines showing and they all fell back
quietly. She walked limply towards a corner and lay down on one side
of her flank.  Blood was trickling down from above her hind leg cut
open by a wound.  Her breath came out in broken grunts. Her neck
shuddered with pain as she turned to lick her wound but it would not
reach.  In defeat she put her head down on the pebbled floor.  She was
exhausted and famished.  Then she felt soft clicking of tounges
against her torn flesh. One of her cubs came and licked her face and
nose and the lenght of her furry neck. This time she did not growl at
them.  The scowls of pain on her face were melting . She was looking
outside the cave , a window of clear blue sky and white mountains
shining in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
“Where you left your Baba?” asked Bhola's wife . Her daughter had
returned back alone. “Baba met someone on our way back. Then baba told
me you go home I will come afterwards.”
</p>

<p>
It was late in the night. Bhola had not yet come. Bhola's wife was
pacing from wall to wall and immediately coming out on hearing the
slightest of noise. Her daughter had refused to sleep till Bhola did
not come but she couldn't keep up and fell asleep.  The plastic board
which served as the door was slowly pushed open and Bhola staggered
in. His clothes were torn at places and his left eye was puffy and
black. His hair was messed all over , blood was oozing out from a deep
cut below his chin . There were a few scratches on his face.
</p>

<p>
“What happened to you?”cried his wife out aloud. His lips fumbled
silently. She supported his back by holding across his sholuders and
helped him into the bed. His back was covered with foot prints stamped
all over. He kept on mumbling something till he fell unconscious.
</p>

<p>
It was in afternoon when Bhola woke up. As he tried to get up pain
prickled all over his muscles and bones . His wounds were clean and
dressed. His daughter was sitting besides bent over her drawing book.
“Amma Baba got up.” shouted his daughter. His wife appeared from the
kitchen corner .  “How do you feel now?” said his wife.  Her unkempt
hair fell across her back, her eyes were puffed from waking all night
, her stained cheeks were glistening with fresh tears and new lines
had crept over her face.  Bhola felt the beats of his heart slowing
down. A terrible anguish welled up within him as he looked at her
pained face.  .  “I am all right.It will be fine.” he wanted to say
but words had left him.
</p>

<p>
 “Here see my new drawing Baba”. His daughter held up the drawing to
his face. It was the sketch of mountains, river and a hut.  “Look I
got the roof right this time. Does my drawing look nice now?” she said
. Her face was beaming with pride.  The numbness within him broke into
a smile of sadness.  “ It's beautiful now.” he said.
