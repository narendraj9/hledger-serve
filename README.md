# hledger-serve

A simple web application for hledger journals. The backend is written in Haskell using the Yesod Framework. The frontend is
written in Elm. 

I have it running here: http://services.vicarie.in

## TODO 

1. Refactor code. 
2. Reduce the number of database accesses. It's terrible as of now.
3. Add login buttons for github and facebook.
